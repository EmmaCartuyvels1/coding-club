## Mission statement

The INBO Coding Club unites all ecologists, researchers and coders who want to develop their (R) programming skills in a pleasant and supportive environment in order to replace the fear for coding with inspiration and motivation to learn.

class: left, middle

## Expect this

- How to read the data with such awkward text format provided by OCOSA (Office for Complication of Otherwise Simple Affairs)?
- What is the purpose of the `%>%` operator?
- How can I _join_ two data.frames in R?
- How to convert some scattered code into a reusable R function?
- ...

---
class: left, middle

## Do NOT expect this

- Is a GLM the proper choice for my experiment?
- How to implement a species distribution model?
- What is machine learning?

## As coding club

- is NOT a helpdesk
- is NOT a scientific tutorial
- is NOT a lunchtalk

class: left, middle

## So, practically...

The coding club is held monthly on alternate Tuesday and Thursday, from 10 a.m. to 12 a.m., in Herman Teirlinck building (Tour & Taxis, Brussels).

class: left, middle

## So, practically...

- The coding club is typically limited to 25 participants (room capacity). It will soon increase to 40 from Jan, 2020 onwards
- Each session focusses on a specific theme and is <u>independent</u> from previous sessions
- No laptop, no party. We code, after all!

## Who organises the coding club?

The dream team

![:scale 70%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20191022_codingclub_team.png)

---
class: left, middle

## Tasks

The core team takes care of:

- reservation of the lecture room
- thematic topics, working material and some challenges to work on
- general agenda: __take into account feedback from participants!__
- documentation for [participants](https://inbo.github.io/coding-club/gettingstarted.html) and [organizers](https://inbo.github.io/coding-club/workflow.html) (step-by-step workflow to organize a coding club)
- [code of conduct](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

---
class: left, middle

## Did we figure that out ourselves?

No :-)
<br>
<br />
Some initiatives we got inspiration from:
- [ourcodingclub Edinburgh](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/).
- initiatives showing that coding together can sensibly improve ecological/environmental research. See the [Ocean Health Index project paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160).
- Software and Data Carpentry organisation: bye bye coding fear! See their inspiring [ecology workshop](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop).

### First time coding club?

Most likely YES. <br>
Let's run, all together, the steps in [First time setup](https://inbo.github.io/coding-club/gettingstarted.html#first-time-setup) section to setup our coding club directory.

### Share your code during the coding session!

<!-- Create a new hackmd file and replace this link (twice!) -->
Go to https://hackmd.io/mv-Ng9V5R2KZyQbUUFmDcA?both

### Install and load the package suite

If not yet done, install `tidyverse`:<br>
`install.packages("tidyverse")`
<p>Load it in your R session by typing:<br>
`library(tidyverse)`</p>

## Download data and source file

- Go to [`data`](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/tree/master/data)
- Datasets you gave to us have prefix `20200121`. Click on yours and download* it to `/data` folder.
- Click [`20200121_challenges.R`](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20200121_challenges.R) and download* script file in `/src` folder.

* __Note__: check the getting started instructions on [how to download a single file](https://inbo.github.io/coding-club/gettingstarted.html#each-session-setup)

# Challenge 1. Import

Import your dataset.
Excel: `read_excel`
- What is the `head()` of your data.frame?
- What is the `str()`ucture of your data.frame?
- Did you know you can inspect some `summary()` statistics?
- Did you know you can calculate `nrows()` and `ncols()`?

# Challenge 2. Explore

- Did you know you can know how many `distinct()` values you have?
- Did you know you can `filter()` rows?
    1. `count()` how many NAs you have in a column. Tip: use `is.na()`
    2. Filter rows with NAs in a specific column out and assign (`<-`) the result as a new data.frame
- Did you know you can `select()` columns?
- Did you know you can `rename()` a column?
- Calculate `min()`, `max()` and `mean()` of a column

# Intermezzo: the ggplot recipe

What do you need to make a plot?
The ggplot recipe says you need:
1. data
2. mapping (essentially which columns you want to use)
3. geometry (do you want a bar plot, line plot, histogram, ...?)

# Challenge 3. Visualize

Make two plots from your data. Try to make them shining. Maybe by improving the `xlab()`?

# Tutorials online

There is a lot of documentation and tutorials online:

1. Datacarpentry: [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/): the most clear and comprehensive lesson on using R for ecology data ever.

2. [Stanford University tutorial about ggplot2](https://cengel.github.io/R-data-viz/data-visualization-with-ggplot2.html).
