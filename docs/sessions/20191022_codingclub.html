## A coding club session to speak about... coding club

But that's meta-coding club!

### Share your code/answers/problems during the coding session!

## First time coding club?

- Do you have R and RSudio installed? Great! If not, go to [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) and sign up.

- Check the [First time setup](https://inbo.github.io/coding-club/gettingstarted.html#first-time-setup) section to setup. Skip part about installing packages: we don't need any package today.

Fill in this _hackmd_ [questionnaire](https://hackmd.io/IucYoto4SnmMYAJowJ9Uvw)

Download script [20191022_challenges.R](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20191022_challenges.R) and check for each of the `wont_work` steps the error message to identify what is going wrong.<br>
Discuss with your neighbour: Is there a common pattern in these error messages?
<br>Once done, insert your answer in [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/IucYoto4SnmMYAJowJ9Uvw?view#Challenge-3) and put a third sticky note on your laptop.

<code><br>## function 'sum' ----
<br>wont_work <- c('a', 'b', 'c')
<br>sum(wont_work)
<br>will_work <- 1:10
<br>sum(will_work)
<br>...
</code>

# Challenge 3

Goal: Make the file [20190124_survey_part1.xlsx](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20190124_survey_part1.xlsx) as tidy as possible.

1. Pair up with your neighbour.
2. Download* data file.
3. Do not modify the file. A (very) good practice: raw data should never be modified!
4. Document the issues you encountered in the chapter [_challenge 1_ of hackmd](https://hackmd.io/IucYoto4SnmMYAJowJ9Uvw?view#Challenge-1), below the questionnaire. Start a new subsection with your name, e.g. `### Damiano`.

## Mission statement

The INBO Coding Club unites all ecologists, researchers and coders who want to develop their (R) programming skills in a pleasant and supportive environment in order to replace the fear for coding with inspiration and motivation to learn.

---
class: left, middle

## Expect this

- How to read the data with such awkward text format provided by OCOSA (Office for Complication of Otherwise Simple Affairs)?
- What is the purpose of the `%>%` operator?
- How can I _join_ two data.frames in R?
- How to convert some scattered code into a reusable R function?
- ...

---
class: left, middle

## Do NOT expect this

- Is a GLM the proper choice for my experiment?
- How to implement a species distribution model?
- What is machine learning?

## As coding club

- is NOT a helpdesk
- is NOT a scientific tutorial
- is NOT a lunchtalk

---
class: left, middle

## So, practically...

The coding club is held monthly on alternate Tuesday and Thursday, from 10 a.m. to 12 a.m., in Herman Terilinck building (Tour & Taxis, Brussels).
<br>
![:scale 75%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20191022_building_and_room.png)

---
class: left, middle

## So, practically...

- The coding club is typically limited to 25 participants (room capacity). It will increase soon to 40 from Jan, 2020
- Each session focusses on a specific theme and is <u>independent</u> from previous sessions
- No laptop, no party. We code, after all!

## Who organises the coding club?

The dream team

![:scale 70%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20191022_codingclub_team.png)

---
class: left, middle

## Tasks

The core team takes care of:

- reservation of the lecture room
- thematic topics, working material and some challenges to work on
- general agenda, __taking into account the feedback of the participants__
- documentation for [participants](https://inbo.github.io/coding-club/gettingstarted.html) and [organizers](https://inbo.github.io/coding-club/workflow.html).
- [code of conduct](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

More details: Check [this page](https://inbo.github.io/coding-club/workflow.html) to see the step-by-step workflow to organize an INBO coding club.

## Did we figure that out ourselves?

No :-)
<br>
<br />
Some initiatives we got inspiration from:
- [ourcodingclub Edinburgh](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/).
- initiatives showing that coding together can sensibly improve ecological/environmental research. See the [Ocean Health Index project paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160).
- Software and Data Carpentry organisation: bye bye coding fear! See their inspiring [ecology workshop](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop).

## Resources

INBO coding club material is open and available online. Take a look, get inspired and inspire us.

## Challenge 4

So far our experience taught us:

1. Start easy: we started with a shared directory on Google Drive...
2. [DOCUMENTATION for participants](https://inbo.github.io/coding-club/gettingstarted.html).
3. [DOCUMENTATION for maintainers](https://inbo.github.io/coding-club/workflow.html)

<br>
Ideas? Questions? Doubts? We will try to track all them in [hackmd chapter Discussion](https://hackmd.io/IucYoto4SnmMYAJowJ9Uvw?view#Discussion).
