library(tidyverse) # to do datascience
library(readxl) # to read Excel files

### Challenge 1: data import

# import your dataset


# What is the `head()` of your data.frame?


# What is the `str()`ucture of your data.frame?


# Did you know you can inspect some `summary()` statistics?


# Did you know you can get `nrow()` and `ncol()`?



### Challenge 2: data exploration/transformation

# - Did you know you can know how many `distinct()` values you have?


# - Did you know you can `filter()` rows?
#   1. `count()` how many NAs you have in a column. Tip: use `is.na()`


#   2. Filter rows with NAs in a specific column out and assign (`<-`) the result as a new data.frame


# - Did you know you can `select()` columns?


# - Did you know you can `rename()` a column?


# - Calculate `min()`, `max()` and `mean()` of a column



### Challenge 3: data visualization

# 1. Make two basic plots from your data based on intermezzo


# 2. Customize them a little more and make them shining
