# Challenge 1

- Using the interface of Rstudio, create an **Rmarkdown** New File,
with an HTML output format. Save the document and **Knit** it
to an HTML page.
- Play with it a little by changing title, author, date, adding new sections...

## Intermezzo 1

- Did you know you can set date authomatically?

# Challenge 2

Tables

- Create a markdown table in markdown itself (no R!)
- Create a nicely rendered markdown table of the `head(mtcars)` using R, the `kable` function and test how crazy you can go with [kableExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html#text_specification) package!

## Intermezzo 2

- Do you want always nice tables with the smallest effort possible? Set `df_print` argument in header!

- And did you know you can set a table of content as well?

# Challenge 3

Do you have a R file you use often but never had the time to transform it in a nice Rmarkdown document for sharing with team, colleagues, scientists, ...? This is the perfect moment to (start to) do it! Make sure it is self-contained, so it can be rerun by someone else or the future-you.

If you don't have such a file, you can transform this R file about geese counts: [`20190829_challenge.R`](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20190829_challenge.R). Download* it in `./src` folder. Download also data file [`20190829_goose_counts_2018.csv`](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20190829_goose_counts_2018.csv) to `./data` folder.

You want to try something special? See some alternative [format options](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html).

<small>* __Note__: check the getting started instructions on [how to download a single file](https://inbo.github.io/coding-club/gettingstarted.html#each-session-setup)</small>

## Did you knew that...

1. Many INBO tutorials are written in R markdown and then _knitted_ as markdown documents? See [example](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_gbif_name_matching/).
2. [Data processing pipelines](https://trias-project.github.io/alien-plants-belgium/dwc_mapping.html) published as GitHub pages are R markdown documents?
3. Hackmd pages follow markdown syntax?

## Go pro

From a R markdown document to a full INBO report? Get inspired by nice [Thierry's workshop](https://inbomd-examples.netlify.com/inbomd_workshop/inbomd_workshop.pdf).
