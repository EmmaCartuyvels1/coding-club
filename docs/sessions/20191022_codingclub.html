    this is not a coding tutorial.

## A coding club session to speak about... coding club

But that's meta-coding club! ;-)

## Mission

The INBO Coding Club unites all ecologists, researchers and coders who want to develop their (R) programming skills in a pleasant and supportive environment in order to replace the fear for coding with inspiration and motivation to learn.

## Expect this

- How to read the data with such awkward text format provided by OCOSA (Office for Complication of Otherwise Simple Affairs)?
- What is the purpose of the `%>%` operator?
- How can I JOIN two tables in R?
- How to convert some scattered code into a reusable R function?
- ...

## Do NOT expect this

- Is a GLM the proper choice for my experiment?
- How to implement a species distribution model?
- What is machine learning?

## So, practically...

- The coding club is typically limited to 25 participants (room capacity). It will increase soon to 40 in 2020...
- Each session focusses on a specific theme and is <u>independent</u> from previous sessions
- No laptop, no party. We code, after all!

## Who organises the coding club?

Five people, the dream team

## Tasks

The core team takes care of:

- reservation of the lecture room
- thematic topics, working material and some challenges to work on
- general agenda, __taking into account the feedback of the participants__

## Did we figure that out ourselves?

No :-)
<br>
<br />
Some initiatives we got inspiration from:
- [ourcodingclub Edinburgh](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/).
- initiatives showing that coding together can sensibly improve ecological/environmental research. See the [__Ocean Health Index project paper__](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160).
- Software and Data Carpentry organisation: bye bye coding fear! See their inspiring [ecology workshop](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop).

Let's start a short coding club session then...
