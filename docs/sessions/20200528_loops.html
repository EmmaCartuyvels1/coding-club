# The `for` loop in R

No loop has been more used (and abused) by R users than the **for loop**<br>.

# Why loops?

[DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) ("<strong>D</strong>on't <strong>R</strong>epeat <strong>Y</strong>ourself")
<p>![:scale 90%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20200528/20200528_loops_why.png)</p>

DRY is the enemy of WET ("write every time", "write everything twice", "we enjoy typing" or "waste everyone's time")

# Challenge 1

Write `for` loops to:

1. Compute the mean of every column in [`swiss`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/swiss.html).
2. Determine the type of each column in  [`iris`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/iris.html).
3. Compute the number of unique values in each column of `iris`.
4. Generate 10 random normals (`rnorm(n = 10)`) from distributions with means of -10, 0, 10, and 100.

# Challenge 2

- Download* [`20200528/20200528_births_belgium.txt`](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20200528/20200528_births_belgium.txt) in your folder `./data/20200528/`. It contains the number of births per month in Belgium from 1992 to 2019. Based on a [StatBel open dataset](https://statbel.fgov.be/en/open-data/number-births-day).
- Download* R script [`20200528/20200528_challenges.R`](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20200528/20200528_challenges.R) in your folder `./src/20200528`

The code in challenge 2 makes a bar plot of the number of births in Belgium per month in 2010 and save it as a png file. How to do the same for every year from 2010 to 2019 without repeating yourself 10 times?

# INTERMEZZO 1: nested loops

What if you put a loop in another loop?

Some dummy examples:

```r
years <- c(2019:2020)
seasons <- c("winter", "spring", "summer", "autumn")
for (year in years) {
  for (season in seasons) {
    print(paste0("year:",year, ". Season:", season))
  }
}

"year:2019. Season:winter"
"year:2019. Season:spring"
"year:2019. Season:summer"
"year:2019. Season:autumn"
"year:2020. Season:winter"
"year:2020. Season:spring"
"year:2020. Season:summer"
"year:2020. Season:autumn"
```

# INTERMEZZO 1: nested loops

All possible positions on a chessboard

```r
columns <- letters[1:8]
rows <- 1:8
for (row in rows) {
  for (column in columns) {
    print(paste0("Position: ", column, row))
  }
}

"Position: a1"
"Position: b1"
"Position: c1"
"Position: d1"
"Position: e1"
"Position: f1"
"Position: g1"
"Position: h1"
"Position: a2"
...
"Position: f8"
"Position: g8"
"Position: h8"
```

# INTERMEZZO 2: `while` loop

When the end of the loop is not known beforehand, but it depends on a condition, then the for-loop cannot help you. You need a <strong>while</strong>-loop.

Example: playing dices. Play until you get more than 10 throwing two dices.

```r
result <- 0
n <- 0
while (result < 10) {
  n <- n + 1 # game number
  dice <- sample(1:6, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
  result <- sum(dice)
  print(paste0("Game number: ", n, ". Result: ", result))
}

"Game number: 1. Result: 8"
"Game number: 2. Result: 3"
"Game number: 3. Result: 9"
"Game number: 4. Result: 11"
```

Many videogames are actually a big while loop!

# Challenge 3. The Fox slot machine

<p>The goal of a fox is to reproduce before it dies.</p>
<p>The fox dies for sure after 10 years in the wild. But it can die earlier due to poison (one of the possible `foods`) or by an enemy (all `enemies` except `"safe"`).</p>
<p>The "fox game" ends when the fox succeeds to reproduce or when it dies.</p>
By using the code provided in [`20200528/20200528_challenges.R`] and using loop techniques:
1. simulate the fox life. Does the fox succeed to reproduce? Or does it die before?
2. Extend the game to a population of 10 foxes. How many foxes succeeded to reproduce?
